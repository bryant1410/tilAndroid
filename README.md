# Today I Learned Android
I fell in love with Android App development ever since I first started building stuff on it since my senior year of high school in 2010-2011. While in college a few of my friends and I started an organization that teaches students Android, iOS, and Webapp Development, and it was one of the things that I'm most proud of. Since graduating I wanted to spread the love a bit more and use this repo to provide mini tutorials for Android App development.
