#Today I Learned Android
I fell in love with Android App development ever since I first started building stuff on it since my senior year of high school in 2010-2011. While in college a few of my friends and I started an organization that teaches students Android, iOS, and Webapp Development, and it was one of the things that I'm most proud of. Since graduating I wanted to spread the love a bit more and use this repo to provide mini tutorials for Android App development.


This is a work in progress so please bear with me. My goal is to have at least two new tutorials each week. If you have any tutorial requests and such, feel free to open up an issue and place your request there! Or, if you'd like submit your own tutorial as a pull request!
